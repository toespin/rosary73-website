## Required Screenshots

Please add the following screenshots (preferably PNG format, tall enough to scroll):

### 1. `homescreen.png`
- **Description:** The main HomeScreen showing the 7 prayer beads
- **Recommended size:** 1170 x 2532 pixels (iPhone 14 Pro resolution)
- **Content to capture:**
  - Full HomeScreen with all 7 beads visible
  - Welcome message at top
  - Daily quote if visible
  - Bottom navigation
  - Make sure the screenshot is tall enough to enable vertical scrolling in the mockup

### 2. `visual-rosary.png`

  - Progress indicator
  - Participant names or avatars

## How to Take Screenshots on iPhone

1. **iPhone with Face ID:** Press Side button + Volume Up simultaneously
2. **iPhone with Home button:** Press Side button + Home button simultaneously

## Tips for Best Results

- Use **Light Mode** for screenshots (matches website light theme better)
- Make sure the screen content is representative of actual app usage
- If possible, capture full-length screenshots using the "Full Page" feature in Safari or scrolling screenshot apps
- Higher resolution = better quality in the mockups

## File Naming

Keep the exact filenames as listed above:
- `homescreen.png`
- `visual-rosary.png`
- `record-prayers.png`

The website code looks for these exact filenames.

## Fallback Behavior

If screenshots are not found, the website will display attractive placeholder content with icons and descriptive text, so the page will still look professional while you prepare the actual screenshots.

*Once you add the screenshots, push them to this folder and the website will automatically display them in the scrolling iPhone mockups!*
